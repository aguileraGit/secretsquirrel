## Still to do...

## General
- [x] Move away from multiple Github libraries if possible.
- [x] Better error checking for logging in
- [x] IP is hard coded in xinitrc, ~~app.py~~, ~~js~~, and ~~index.html~~. Nothing I can do about xinitrc.
- [ ] Disable zoom on screen
- [ ] Verify the heart is clickable - It's not!
- [ ] ~~[Make more powerful](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=266361&p=1619404#p1619404)~~
- [x] Add form field for 'nickname' so multiple ones exist
- [x] ~~Text isn't perfectly centered.~~ It's good enough.
- [ ] Better error handling if bad Token or unable to connect to Github.

## 3D Print case
- [x] Need to add 3D stand-offs
- [x] ~~Make the USB hole bigger or ...~~
- [x] Make a small tab that slides in with room for the cable
- [x] Push files online
- [ ] Add holes for hanging

## ReadMe/Documentation
- [ ] Update ReadMe to include general statement about the interaction with Github
 - Adds key
 - Creates gist
- [ ] Link for Github ssh setup - https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
- [ ] Removal instructions
- [ ] Add FAQ

## Features
- [x] Add images~~/movies~~. Use regex to capture jpg/jpeg/gif/svg or link to youtube and embed. **Code is in. Needs to be tested. Causes errors when syncing front/back end**. Works. Didn't implement movies because there's no speaker.
- [ ] Turn off display at night
- [ ] Control backlight using Python
